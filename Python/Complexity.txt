Boys, so again we are around time complaxity and this time we will do it once for all.

Time Complexity
---------------------

* So, the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task
  (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time).

* The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number
  of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity. 

* When we analyse an algorithm, 
  we use a notation to represent its time complexity and that notation is Big O notation.

* The Time complexity or Big O notations for some popular algorithms are listed below:

    1. Binary Search: O(log n)
    2. Linear Search: O(n)
    3. Quick Sort: O(n * log n)
    4. Selection Sort: O(n * n)
    5. Travelling salesperson : O(n!)
